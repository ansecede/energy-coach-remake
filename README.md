# energy-coach-remake
Mobile app remake from a final degree project. The app was develop in React-Native. Back-end services consisted in Firebase and Python scripts in a Raspberry Pi

## Some details about the app
Source code from the original project:  https:/ /github.com/dsgarcia8/energy-coach

It was made in React-Native as part of a final degree project that focused on reducing energy consumption in a laboratory at ESPOL university without affecting the comfort of the students. The original app was made in 2021, and after the project was finished it was put aside, so when trying to get it up again we had a lot of problems, so we determined that the best thing to do would be to redo it from scratch using the same source code.
